## HashBox Mail - The Smart Contract Mail

### Project Description

#### What is HashBox Mail?

It's a mail built on the blockchain using smart contracts to send and receive messages and files, eliminating the need for middlemen controlling the data. Without intermediaries, data cannot be changed or censored by a company.


#### What kind of problem is solved?

Due to the nature of the blockchain that all data on it is public, anyone who knows a user's wallet address can know how much money the user has. If it is an exorbitant amount, this information could put that person's safety at risk if a criminal knows where the user lives or goes to. 

For this reason, no user should link his personal information (SSN, home address, telephone number or workplace address) to his wallet address. A criminal knowing someone's email address, can easily discover his home address or sensitive information from a resume posted online.

The solution removes this need for the user to expose personal information, using only his wallet address to communicate, to receive information or files from a company or another user. An online platform only needs to know the user's wallet address - if he has the necessary amount or if he has already paid for the product/service offered.

#### Why is this application so important?

It's important because this is one of the few applications on the blockchain that is not:

- A coin project (Bitcoin for example);
- A token project (to exchange business, intellectual property or private property rights);
- An NFT project (to exchange image, video, audio, text or game character);
- A DeFi project (to exchange tokens);
- A DNS project (to translate a hexadecimal address into a human-readable name).

This is a project for communication: Communication on the blockchain.

Many apps work like this:

a) User A sends a message to the App;

b) The App resends the message to User B.
  
The core of HashBox Mail is to remove the "App".

The "App" is not needed with the blockchain and the smart contracts, everything is peer-to-peer (P2P).

With the core of this project, you can build:

- A decentralized Uber - user asks driver for ride on the blockchain without the Uber;
- A decentralized DoorDash - user requests a delivery on the blockchain without the DoorDash;
- A decentralized AirBnb - user rents a house on the blockchain without the AirBnb.

With all the rules written using smart contracts. Immutable, forever.

"Blockchain Day By Day" - This is HashBox's motto.

Note: This project can be used by people even in the bear market, because this is a utility project not tied to the crypto market.


#### What kind of integration can be done with this protocol?

You can integrate the HashBox Mail with others dApps, like:

- A decentralized marketplace that sends notifications to users about delivery status;
- A DeFi protocol that communicates with users about newly created liquidity pools and rewards;
- Create a decentralized OTC (Over The Counter) for users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with sellers privately;
- To create a decentralized "heritage network" for crypto (including Bitcoin);
- To be used as a communication layer for DAOs;
- To be used as a communication layer for blockchain games;
- A protocol token (RING) can be used as the “email fee” and so on.


### Team

The project was developed only by me (Silvio Guedes). 

I have more than ten years of professional experience in development, with deep knowledge of the languages Java, C/C++ for the platforms of mobile devices such as Android, Bada and Windows Mobile. I also know to develop cross-platform applications with Unity 3D and Xamarin (C# language).

### Development Roadmap

The project is already built: [https://mail.hashbox.app](https://mail.hashbox.app)


#### Why do I need grants?

1) Porting the solution to other networks (the solution is currently working on the Polygon Network);
2) To rent and install the dApp on a better VPS server (current has only 2GB of RAM);
3) To rent a better RPC server (I'm using a free tier);
4) To fix few issues about paging results;
5) To improve UI/UX for Feeds and Settings;
6) To create responsive pages;
7) To create a UI for sending multiple emails;
8) What takes place (new issues, legal or accounting problems etc).


#### Budget breakdown and milestones:

| Milestone # | Description | Completion Time | Budget |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|1|Porting the solution to RING network|7 days|$26000|
|2|To rent and install the dApp on a better VPS server|7 days|$1000|
|3|To rent a better RPC server|1 day|$1000|
|4|To fix few issues about paging results|1 month|$4000|
|5|To improve UI/UX for Feeds and Settings|1 month|$4000|
|6|To create responsive pages|1 month|$4000|
|7|To create a UI for sending multiple emails|1 month|$4000|
|8|Other issues (what takes place)|1 month and a half|$6000|

Total: $50,000.


#### What are your maintenance and upgrade plans?

The project will have upgrades for deprecated libraries (HTML and Javascript).

The smart contracts code will never be upgraded, because they are immutable and don't use proxies.

The project is open source, so anyone can improve it too.


### Additional Information

The project is already running: [https://mail.hashbox.app](https://mail.hashbox.app)


#### Did you receive any investment from VCs?

No. I built the project with my own money. I spent almost 3 years and over 20K dollars to build the protocol.

The main objective is to create a utility project not linked to the cryptocurrency market: you don't need to know how much 1 Bitcoin costs if you have to communicate with someone. If you need to communicate, you'll do it without worrying about the price of Bitcoin.

If the project is successful, I support the project by selling the credits (HBMs).


#### What is the target audience?

The target audience is the blockchain user. 


#### What are your adoption, reach, and growth strategies?

Blockchain mass adoption involves creating daily applications.

The adoption, reach and growth will be driven by applications using the HashBox Mail, the “daily apps”, like: a ride app, a delivery app, a house rent app, etc. 

In order to have these applications using the protocol, it is necessary to reach out to blockchain companies, blockchain builders and blockchain users to make them aware that blockchain has more functions than just functioning as a financial infrastructure. 

For the project be successful, I must to create networks first.


#### What are the differences between HashBox Mail and other "blockchain mail" solutions?

This is a 100% blockchain solution: All emails are registered on the blockchain, all rules are executed on the blockchain and written using smart contracts.

Nobody can censor the protocol, nobody can change the rules of the protocol, nobody can stop the protocol. Including me, the creator.


#### Who are your competitors?

There is the Point Mail, but it works only on the Point Network blockchain: [https://pointnetwork.io](https://pointnetwork.io).

There are other dApps like "decentralized blockchain mail", but they don't work on the blockchain and/or can't be easily ported to other blockchain:

[https://dmail.ai](https://dmail.ai)

[https://ledgermail.io](https://ledgermail.io)


#### What kind of features are there in this protocol and why are they important?

A great feature is the ability to get paid when you receive an email. No more SPAMs!

Example:

If you set a fee of 1 Bitcoin (1 WBTC), you will always receive 1 BTC for any email, message or file from anyone any time you receive an email. Your attention will always be rewarded.

"Pay Attention" never made so much sense.


That's it for now. Thanks for your attention.
